Week1: Design Patterns and Principles

Exercise 2: Implementing the Factory Method Pattern

The Factory Method pattern provides a way to create objects without specifying their exact class.
It defines a method for creating an object, allowing subclasses to choose which class to instantiate.

Expected input: Bike / Car : Explicit input is not needed, main() method itself is enough.

Expected output:
Ananya's Car is ready
Ananya's Bike is ready
