Week-1 : Design Patterns and Principles

Exercise 1: Implementing the Singleton Pattern
Singleton pattern means ensuring that a class can only ever have one single instance during the whole program’s life, and you give everyone a global access point to that one instance.
->It restricts a class from being instantiated multiple times by making its constructor private and instead offering a public, static method that returns the single existing object.

Expected input: There’s no input to this program — it just runs the main() method.

Expected output:
I am Ananya
Hey, this is Singleton created by Ananya
Are both the same? true
