Exercise 2: E-commerce Platform Search Function

This exercise describes a search feature in an e-commerce platform that matches product names against a keyword.
A fixed list of product names is scanned for any partial match of the keyword.
If matches exist, they are displayed one per line; otherwise, a message indicates that nothing matches.

Expected input: A keyword like "phone"

Expected output:
All matching product names containing that keyword printed one per line, or a message if nothing matches.
