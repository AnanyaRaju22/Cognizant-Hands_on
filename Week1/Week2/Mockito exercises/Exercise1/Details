Exercise 1: Mocking and Stubbing – Mockito with JUnit 5

Scenario:
We’re testing a ShoppingCart class that depends on a ProductService to get product prices.
Using Mockito, we’ll mock the ProductService so we can test ShoppingCart in isolation.

Description:
We mocked ProductService using mock()
We stubbed getPrice("P123") to return 100.0
We tested ShoppingCart.calculateTotal() without needing real product data

Expected Input & Output:
Product ID  	Stubbed Price	    Quantity	  Expected Total
P123          	100.0	             3	         300.0
