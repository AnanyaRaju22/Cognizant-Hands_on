Mockito Exercise 2: Verifying Interactions

Scenario:
You have a NotificationService that sends messages using a MessageSender.
Youâ€™ll use Mockito to:
Mock the dependency (MessageSender)
Call methods on the real class
Verify that the expected interactions happened.

Description:
This example demonstrates how to:
Mock a dependency
Call the real method
Verify that methods were called with expected arguments
Use verify(), times(), never(), and anyString() for interaction verification

Expected Interactions:
Method             	Called With
sendEmail(...)   	"user123", "Welcome..."
sendSMS(...)     	"user123", "Welcome..."
